This repository contains the MATLAB code to solve the population dynamics model described in the research paper by Carbonari & Emmanuel (2025) on modeling pore size evolution during sandstone cementation.

The code is run via the main file: optimization_code_ultim.m
Additional files:
init_pdf_N2.m - initial pore size distribution
fin_pdf_N2.m - final pore size distribution
compfunc_ultim.m - pde solver
diffnorm_pores_ultim.m - calculation of norm
